bootstrap-modal-carousel
========================

A set of plugins to display a carousel into a fullscreen modal box

This set of JavaScript and CSS extensions to Twitter Boostrap was made in order to display a carousel in fullscreen. I decided to extend the libraries step by step by separate the feature I needed, which resulted in the following independent "packages" :

1. the ability to detach a content to a modal box
2. make a modal into fullscreen mode
3. a carousel which fit itself according to the different images and captions
4. and one to link them all


**Feel free to use them and/or contribute to make them better.**

In the docs folder, you'll find some HTML demos.

Todo:
* Propose a minified package of the JavaScripts and
* A lazy loader for images
* Surely many things...
